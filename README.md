**UnversityEducation_ElectricalEngineering** is a project designed to simulate and manage various aspects of an Electrical Engineering education system within a university. The project showcases object-oriented programming concepts, circuit analysis, and simulations relevant to the field of electrical engineering.
## Overview
The project models an educational system focused on Electrical Engineering, including classes for students, courses, professors, and labs. It provides tools for managing coursework, simulating electrical circuits, and analyzing electrical systems.
## Features
- **Student Management**: Create and manage records for electrical engineering students.- **Course Management**: Define and manage electrical engineering courses, including theory and lab components.- **Circuit Simulation**: Simulate basic electrical circuits and analyze their behavior.- **Lab Management**: Manage laboratory sessions, including equipment and experiments.- **Professor Management**: Assign professors to courses and manage their responsibilities.
## Project Structure
- **Main.java**: The main entry point of the application, handling user interaction and overall program flow.- **Student.java**: Class representing an electrical engineering student, with attributes like name, ID, and enrolled courses.- **Course.java**: Class representing an electrical engineering course, including theoretical and lab sections.- **Lab.java**: Class for managing lab sessions, experiments, and equipment.- **Circuit.java**: Class that provides basic circuit simulation capabilities.- **Professor.java**: Class representing a professor specializing in electrical engineering.
## Usage
To run the application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash   git clone https://github.com/Therad445/UnversityEducation_ElectricalEngineering.git   ```
2. Compile the project:
   ```bash   javac Main.java   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash   java Main   ```
## Example Usage
Once the program is running, you'll be prompted to manage different aspects of the Electrical Engineering department. For example:
```Select an option:1. Add Electrical Engineering Student2. Add Course (Theory/Lab)3. Enroll Student in Course4. Assign Professor to Course5. Simulate Circuit6. Manage Lab Sessions7. Exit```
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform tasks such as enrolling students, managing courses, or running circuit simulations.
